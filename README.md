#Info

Repo to automatic label headpose for different datasets. The final model uses an ensemble of models derived from the following two repositories:
1) Deep Learning Head Pose Estimation using PyTorch (https://github.com/natanielruiz/deep-head-pose)
2) FSA-Net: Learning Fine-Grained Structure Aggregation for Head Pose Estimation from a Single Image (https://github.com/shamangary/FSA-Net)

Note that the files for each repo has been slightly modified.
